                Grain is a YC-backed fintech company with a goal to give people fair access to credit and help users raise their credit score using their existing debit card.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a product designer, I spent 3 months redesigning the current app from the ground up, and implementing a design system to support product-based decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Design Goal: Evoke trust in users, while designing for retention</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, how do we empower users to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Have knowledge about good credit use
                </li>
                <li>
                    Not feel negatively about credit
                </li>
                <li>Draw attention to improving their credit standing</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                While also serving the needs of growth and retention for the business?
            </p>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section">
            <h3>Designing For Trust</h3>
            <p>In the fintech space, it’s crucial to design products that users can trust, not only for security purposes, but for longevity in creating a relationship with customers. Design sits at the forefront of this, playing an immediate role in how someone can perceive the platform in reference to other software their familiar with, by both visual and product interaction standpoints.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="../img/grainstyles.png" class="project-content-img">
        <p class="project-section">
            In an effort to reinforce calmness and approachability, we used a blue-based color scheme throughout the app. Being one of the first fintech companies to display a user’s credit utilization ratio, which is how much of their credit limit they’re using, we introduced a secondary palette to correspond to certain ranges in both utilization and credit score.
        </p>
        <div class="project-section">
            <h3>Credit Zones</h3>
            <p>Being that our target product market was users that are just entering the credit space, a learning gap exists in reference to how usage of credit can impact your credit score.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, we saw an opportunity to inform users about credit utilization, one of the biggest factors that impacts credit score.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="../img/grainzones.png" class="project-content-img">
        <p>By having three zones, the user is able to grasp their current credit standing right away, through response to red, orange, and green. We used this on the home tab, credit tab, and for knowing which zone you’ll be in after you make certain payment amounts.
        </p>
        <p class="project-section">
            For example, making a large withdraw and being at 80% utilization will show red, an immediate message to users that something is in danger (their credit score).
        </p>
        <div class="project-section">
            <h3>Raising Positivity About Credit</h3>
            <p>One of Grain’s core features is automated credit withdraws and payments. Using Grain, a user can sit back and let the app deposit money into their account automatically based on their spending habits, and let the app pay it off in a timely manner when it knows that a user can afford it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this process, the user is raising their credit score automatically, taking no actions themselves. This opened a perfect opportunity to put a spotlight on a user’s credit score.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="../img/grainscores.png" class="project-content-img">
        <p class="project-section">
            This brings value from the product back into the company in the form of user retention. Our hypothesis was that by highlighting a user’s personal progress very blatantly in the app, users would continue to come back just to check their score. Through customer interviews, we validated that this did stand true when displaying their score front and center.
        </p>
        <div class="project-section">
            <h3>Improving Users’ Current Credit Standing</h3>
            <p>To provide more depth to the profile page and contribute to our missions of showing users’ what good credit use looks like and drawing attention to their current standing, we made decisions to pull and display the main reasons that their score isn’t higher.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="../img/graincreditreasons.png" class="project-content-img">
        <p class="project-section">To stay consistent with the visual cues throughout the app, we used the four colors ranging from danger to success to correlate to the severity that each factor has in reference to impacting credit score. Further, we provide the full description of a credit factor for users to understand each more in depth.</p>
        <div class="project-section">
            <h3>Designing in Product Scope</h3>
            <p>The design system was an ongoing project throughout the whole design cycle. By definition, the platform creates a way for users to improve their credit. Thus, we crafted the messaging across the whole app in terms of visuals and content to contribute to the progress of users understanding and learning more about credit as a whole. In this regard, building the design system for the app helped the product in many more product-focused ways than simply just visual organization.</p>
